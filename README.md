sometimes in life it just works.

The following code will roll 5 6 sided dice, it will then
give the user the opportunity to reroll the dice twice,
lastly it will ask the user for a number then add all 
the dice of that number (no invaild input check implemented) 
to the total score before moving to the next round.
After 6 rounds ( no invaild input check implemented; no
number already selected invalid check implemented 
[dont be a cheater] ) print final score and ask to play again.
